## How-To

Welcome to Cabot Connect!

You should first register to out website. After registering, you will automatically be redirected to the home page in which a Google Map of Cabot Library is displayed.
Upon registering and/or logging in, you must set your status. Go to Set Status at the top left of the page. Please choose which floor of Cabot you are on as well as your location within Cabot.
If and only if you choose a Group Study Room, please specify which room in the Room Number/Details box. To aid with this, Lower Level Cabot and Upper Level Cabot links provide image maps of Cabot Library.
Next, choose your mode; this will allow other students in the library to know whether you are willing to collaborate.
If and only if you choose Group Work mode, please say which class you are working on to allow other students to approach you. Once you have successfully set your status, a page explaining your status will be displayed.
To see your status along with all the other students who have set their status, please click on Table! in the navigation bar. This is the area where your information as well as all the students' information will be displayed.
Once satisfied, click on Map! or the logo to get back to the map.# CabotConnectTrial1
